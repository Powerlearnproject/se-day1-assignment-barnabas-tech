Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science focused on development, testing and maintainance of software
1. Efficiency - It helps optimize the developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards
2. Security - implimenting protection like authentication, encryption and authorization to secure user information.
3. Scalability and flexibility - Ensures that the system can handle increased load without affecting performance.
4. Reliability - Ensures software platforms perform as expected without bias especially in critical applications like healthcare and finance.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering complexity
Mastering process
Mastering machine 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope
Requiremment analysis - Identify the final user specification
Design - Building the framework
Coding - Converting software design into tangible code
Testing - Eamine the software for any bugs and glitches

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology - linear and sequential where every process is first completed before moving on.
- There is low flexibility and changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete
- Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed
- Testing is done at the end of the development process

Agile methodology - Interactive and incremental with multiple cycles or sprints
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into avery sprint
- Testing is continuous and done  after each iteration

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer - developing applications, programs and systemas using proggramming languages and frameoworks
- maintaining and updating softaware to keep it functional
- Collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software
- Reporting to the project manager about the progress of software developmen

Quality assurance officer - Collaborate with satkeholders to understand and clarify software requirement
- Create development stadards and procedures for the programmes to follow
- Collborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software
- Reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development

Prject manager - Assembles and leads the software development team 
- Discuss the project and its requirements  with the client  and software developers
- Create a blueprint of the project
- Tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone
- Delive rthe complete software to the clientand regularly check its performance

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
an integrated development environment(IDE) is a software platform tha facilitates th e creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile and ebug code, sometimes with value adding tools that reduce development eefforts eg Visual Studio Code(VSCode)
Importance:
- Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.
- An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
- an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
- IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. The following are some examples of regular coding tasks that an IDE carries out.
- An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand. - Some programming languages implement just-in-time compiling, in which the IDE converts human-readable code into machine code from within the application.
- Debugging IDE enables a step through the code, line by line, as it runs and inspect code behavior. IDEs also integrate several debugging tools that highlight bugs caused by human error in real time, even as the developer is typing.

Version control systems - These are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time eg Git
Importance:
- Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts
- Change Tracking: records detailed history of change, allowing easy analysis of each modification
- Branching and merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back to the main code
- Error recovery - Allows riverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
 Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry. -
Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
 Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints 
-Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures. 
 Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes. 
Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.
Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. 
Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats
Software Accessibility and Usability - Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users. 
Solution: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  Unit tests - Are close to the source of an application. They consist in testing individual methods and fuctions of the classes, components or modules used by your software, it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components
  Integration tests - Verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together
- Help to eensure that data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected
   System testing - Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
- It helps verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requiremens, including performance, usability and security
  Acceptance tests - They are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire aplication to be running while testing and focus on replicating or behaviors
  
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Prompt engineering is the process wheere you guide generative AI models to generate desired solutions
Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language modelsâ€™ training data.
Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Draw a car.
Draw a blue sprts car with a spoiler and four inch ground clearance drifting up a bend road on a hilly ground
  Clarity - The iproved prompt specifies(A blue spoorts car) rather than just a car
  Specific details - Specifying the appearance( blue car with a spoiler and a bending uphill road) gives clear guidance on the image to be created.
  Concise - : The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.
